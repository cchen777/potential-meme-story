This is a story beginning for cs400 xteam project by Chia-Wei. There was a person
named Peter and he loves basketball. However, he got a disease that obstacle
him from running normally. He tried every doctor but no one could really cure him.
One day, something amazing happened, a wizard came to him and told him about a challenge...

"Go forth, humble player of basketball, and bring me the 3 artifacts of the wizarding world.
A mirror that shows no reflection, the sand of an empty beach, and an orange."
Peter wondered what an orange had anything to do with his devastating condition. But the 
typical adventure found in almost all fantasy books had begun. The hunt was on for these mysterious 
artifacts.


But Peter didn't realise that an orange the power of Vitamin C. A chemical compund so healthy and powerful
it could make him healthy again - riding him of his burden. Peter not knowing the aforementioned rushed to 
the nearest grocery store and bought the best orange he could. To get a mirror with no reflection,
he bought an ordinary mirror covered it in tar. The sand was taken from a beach during a storm.

Trying to hurry back home (well as fast as he could considering he couldn't actually run), he awaited 
the wizard's return to hear what to do next. At 3 AM that night, he heard a knock on the door, and he 
carefully went over to go open the door. Yet it was not the wizard that awaited. It was an young, buff 
man dressed in all black. Turning around, Peter saw that he was covered in numerous scars as well, 
including an angry red one running down his face. "WHERE IS THE WIZARD??" he bellowed, flashing a knife 
up to Peter. Frightened and unsure what to do, Peter just tossed the orange he had been holding in his 
hand this entire time at the scary man's face, slammed the door shut, and quickly went to go hide in his 
closet.

The wizard appeared, and use a magic to cure Peter at the end! This is the end of the story, hope you like the story of Peter :D.
